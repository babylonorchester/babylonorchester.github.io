The Babylon ORCHESTRA and BTMK have exciting news to share! 

![](/styles/pictures/news/nrw.png){:height="25%" width="25%"}

We are happy to announce that we have been granted generous funding for 2019 and 2020 from the Senate Department for Culture and Europe of Berlin to realise a new concert series with 7 events, that sees collaborations with local and international multimedia artists taking place throughout the city. For the first time, Babylon ORCHESTRA will work together with visual and electronic artists from the Middle East and Europe, integrating them into the music performances. We look forward to inviting young and diverse creators from different spheres to exchange and collaborate with our musicians and composers! Performances will take place in alternative venues and clubs across Berlin, with opportunities for the audience to mingle with the artists and musicians after the concerts, while enjoying a drink in the unVEILed lounge spaces.

Local sounds and beats combined with visual arts and new technologies will make for a unique audience experience between traditional oriental vibes and contemporary urban culture - don't miss Babylon ORCHESTRA unVEILed!
